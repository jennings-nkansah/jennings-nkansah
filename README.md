# Hello, geeks! 👋

I am _Jennings Nkansah_. I am a certified network professional, highly skilled and experienced in networking and network security. Since 2021, I have added network programming and automation to my skill set, focusing on the use of Ansible, Terraform, and REST APIs (using Postman) to configure or provision network infrastructure. My goal is to promote network automation and to help others see its value and then embrace it. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. I take criticism well, and use suggestions to improve my work.


### 🌱 What am I doing currently? 
- I work as an Mpesa Network Integration Engineer at Vodafone Ghana
- I write Ansible playbooks for network devices such as Cisco switches and routers, and Fortigate firewalls 


### ⚡ One line that describes me best?
